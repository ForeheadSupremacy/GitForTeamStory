## Our Wonderful Story

1. Once upon a time, there was a **castle**.  
   ![castle](img1.png)

2. Then suddenly, a **dragon** appeared… but maybe it was actually a **robot**?  
   (Nobody is sure yet.)

3. The scientist shouted something very important but nobody wrote it down.  

4. After that, everyone got lost (or maybe teleported?) and somehow there was a **treasure chest**…  
   ![treasure chest](img2.png)

5. Upon opening the chest, they found a map, but it had no directions.

6. “Let’s go to space!” shouted the pirate (although there was no pirate before this).

7. A rocket blasted off, but at the same time the **time machine** broke down.  

8. The cat was supposed to talk here, but the line is missing.  

9. In the forest, the detective discovered… something.  
   (What did they find?)  

10. The ending… well, we don’t really have one. Please fix this.
