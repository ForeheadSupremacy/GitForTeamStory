2. Then, out of nowhere‚ÄîBOOM! üí• A fearsome **dragon** appeared! Or... wait.  but maybe it was actually a **robot**? Was it breathing fire... or was that hydraulic steam? 
   (Nobody is sure yet.)

3. The scientist shouted something very important but nobody wrote it down.  

4. After that, everyone got lost (or maybe teleported?) and somehow there was a **treasure chest**‚Ä¶

5. Someone found a map, but it had no directions.  
   (TODO: add an image of the map?)  

6. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to space!‚Äù shouted the pirate (although there was no pirate before this).  

7. A rocket blasted off, but at the same time the **time machine** broke down.  

8. The cat was supposed to talk here, but the line is missing.  

9. In the forest, the detective discovered‚Ä¶ something.  
   (What did they find?)  

10. The ending‚Ä¶ well, we don‚Äôt really have one. Please fix this.
